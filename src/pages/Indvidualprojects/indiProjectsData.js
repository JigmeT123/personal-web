We place the artworks of the young artists to give them an opportunity to showcase their work, to help them gain recognition and earn money by doing the thing they like the most, art. Considering that in Azerbaijan the field of art is still under development and artists do not get enough recognition for their creativity and are obliged to promote themselves, we decided to create this platform to gather the works of these artists in a single online gallery so they can showcase their works without being concerned about self-promotion. This platform is designed as a combination of an art gallery and a shopping website. Art enthusiasts can view the art pieces, read about them in the gallery section, and get to know the artists better by visiting their profiles. Viewers who want to purchase something will have the contact information of the artist and will buy the item directly from the creator. Thriving Artists is not only an exhibition platform for the art creators but also an online store for the art enthusiasts who enjoy receiving or gifting a piece of art. The prices of the works are determined by the artists themselves. So, at the end of the day, the buyer will not only receive well-priced, handmade artwork but also end up supporting the careers of local artists.",
