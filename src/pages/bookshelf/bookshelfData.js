            "rating": 4,
            "lilAboutBook": "We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness. Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.",

The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.",

            "lilAboutBook": "From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains: 1) How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day make the object invisible to observers 2)How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars. 3) How telepathy and psychokinesis may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology 4)Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one.",

            "author": "Ian Stewart",
            "rating": 5,
            "lilAboutBook": "In In Pursuit of the Unknown, celebrated mathematician Ian Stewart uses a handful of mathematical equations to explore the vitally important connections between math and human progress. We often overlook the historical link between mathematics and technological advances, says Stewart—but this connection is integral to any complete understanding of human history.Equations are modeled on the patterns we find in the world around us, says Stewart, and it is through equations that we are able to make sense of, and in turn influence, our world. Stewart locates the origins of each equation he presents—from Pythagoras's Theorem to Newton's Law of Gravity to Einstein's Theory of Relativity—within a particular historical moment, elucidating the development of mathematical and philosophical thought necessary for each equation's discovery. None of these equations emerged in a vacuum, Stewart shows; each drew, in some way, on past equations and the thinking of the day. In turn, all of these equations paved the way for major developments in mathematics, science, philosophy, and technology.",
